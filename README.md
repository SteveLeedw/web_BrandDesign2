# web_BrandDesign2

This project is brand design project and I used html, css. This project goal was one brand redesign own my design. I wanted to creat Jara shopping mall by own my web page so I added sections these are top, middle, service bar. Actually, if I want to use real fuctions or acting real options I can use javascript, framwork with database. However, this is just web design form or template so I just used html and css.

1 pictuer is top of main page, so there is Zara logo and each different section by drop bar. Also there are slide model pictuer with short infomation like gallery.
